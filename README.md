# OncoNiche
The OncoNiche model identifies contextual information associated with tissue-specific mutated genes. Initially, using the uKIN method, OncoNiche performs guided random walks and heat diffusion in a network propagation framework to detect cancer-risk genes influenced by these mutations, identifying these as cancer-related subnetworks. The connectivity of each subnetwork is quantified through conductance scores. By applying simulated annealing, OncoNiche identifies the subnetwork with the optimal global conductance score. At each iteration of the annealing process, we ensured significant enrichment of tissue-specific mutated and expressed genes within the refined subnetworks. Ultimately, OncoNiche identifies subnetworks closely connected with each tissue-specific mutated gene, which likely reflect the tissue context associated with each tissue-specific mutations.
